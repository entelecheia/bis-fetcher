project_description: '`bis-fetcher` is a Python library that programmatically scrapes
    the website of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to download PDF files
    of all available central bank speeches. It then extracts the text from these PDFs.


    The library allows easy access to a comprehensive dataset of central bank speeches
    over time. Researchers can use this data to perform quantitative analysis of central
    bank communication and track changes in tone, topics, and sentiment.


    The BIS hosts speeches by governors and other senior officials from central banks
    around the world. However, scraping the website manually is tedious. bis-fetcher
    automates the entire workflow from crawling the site to text extraction.


    It provides a simple API to get a list of available speeches, download the PDFs,
    and extract text. The text can be further processed or fed into models for analysis.'
